
The following improvements were made to enhance the accessibility of the Power BI report, with a focus on improving the experience for visually impaired users such as Logan:

Descriptive titles: The titles of the report and each chart were made more descriptive. This enables all users can quickly and easily grasp the report's purpose and the content of each chart.

Alt text: Alternative text descriptions were provided for each chart visual, aligning with inclusive design best practices. This allows users with visual impairments to understand the visualized data, for example, via screen readers. The alt text can also support all users in understanding the purpose and key insights of each chart.

Markers: Markers were added to the line chart. This enhances the accessibility of the visual by providing users with an alternative way to distinguish between data points that is not solely reliant on color.

Shaded colors: Shaded colors were introduced to enhance color contrast within the charts. This helps visually impaired users distinguish between different chart elements more easily.

Tab order: Tab orders for these visuals were changed in the report. This allows users to easily navigate between different elements and sections of the report using their keyboard, which is particularly useful for users with motor difficulties, such as challenges with using a mouse.

Accessible theme: An accessible theme was implemented, designed with features like large, legible fonts and a high-contrast color palette. These features improve the readability and overall accessibility of the report.

These improvements make the report more accessible and create an inclusive environment where all users, regardless of their abilities, can understand and interact effectively with the data.
